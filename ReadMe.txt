Hello, thank you for visiting my site. I started recreating my favorite cartoon characters to explore the possiblities of CSS for illustrative purposes. All of the images were made with HTML and CSS. The site in general is a place to house these creations. 

Hovering over the characters will make their names appear.

Things to add later
- Currently the links in the header are not functional. Later, I will use Javascript to scroll to different places on page, based on the cartoon that was chosen.

-Make responsive for mobile

-Social media links in footer

-MORE CHARACTERS!!!!!!!!!!
